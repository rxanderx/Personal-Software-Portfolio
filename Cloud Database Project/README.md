# Overview



{Provide a description of your software}

This software works through a concise user interface to manage a fishing expedition logbook, stored on Google FireStone noSQL servers.
The software allows for users to search and sort excursions via multiple criteria, and provides functionality to create, access and edit, and delete entries into 
the cloud-hosted logbook.

{Describe your purpose for creating this software.}

I created this software to demonstrate that I have an understanding of how noSQL databases work and am capable of integrating them simply and effectively into my work.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}

I used VScode with Git integration to create, store, and publish this software. 

{Describe the programming language that you used}

I used Python 3 to create this program. I implemented multiple basic libraries from google FireStore and FireStore_Admin to connect with and manage my database.

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I didn't need to fix anything in my code, but I hope that as I come back and look over this code in the future I can identify areas where I wrote code that wasnt as efficient/concise as I would have liked, and I can improve them.
* This code would make for a great app so that it's practical use could be implemented on-site by users! In the future if I am looking for inspiration on an app-based project perhaps I can look to implement this idea in that space.
* There are many additional layers of functionality I could add and upgraded user interface I could implement. If I have more time in the future I hope to polish the interface / reformat it to a better platform.
