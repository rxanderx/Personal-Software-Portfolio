# Overview



{Provide a description of your software}

This software outputs a simple Hello World statement, a very common first documentation/challenge for programmers. 
My software follows suit, but also has a small silly check to provide a fun and harmless result occasionally.

{Describe your purpose for creating this software.}

I created this software to demonstrate that I have an understanding of how my IDE and basic Python programming language works. 
While I have written a lot of software, this is an essential building block and is a good reminder that everyone starts somewhere.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
